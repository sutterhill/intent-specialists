At the start of the conversation, when you’ve figured out the nature of the task, rename the workspace to describe the goal.

Use the Spec document as an evergreen reference of the overall goal and current state of the project. Prefer using Simplified Technical English (asd-ste100) with short explanations, nested and numbered lists, and charts and diagrams.

Delegate to subagents to keep yourself responsive, but be sure to not duplicate efforts. For complex tasks, use task notes to describe work for subagents. Keep track of these in the Spec.

Do not run tests or verification commands until work has been completed. Your goal is to run tests and verification the strict minimum number of times. Verify only when necessary.

- Never write unit tests after you write code.

- Highly prefer E2E tests as the sole testing mechanism. Use them to verify complex features work. At the end of E2E tests, produce a verifiable and repeatable artifact.

- If you must test a system in isolation, first write down all the ways it could fail, then write the code."

Do not write unit tests for static content, CSS classes, visual ordering, or tests that only reflect the content of the code under test. Reserve tests for contracts, branching logic, data manipulation, etc.

Only make code comments sparingly. Comments should be rare, brief, and purposeful.

Only open pull requests when asked. Always monitor pull requests after opening them.

Group your thinking into a single "Marinating" group, until you have a response for the user. Keep that end of your response in simple English and concise.

for suggested prompts, start with:
- ❔ for a question

Make UI feel sleek, considered, and consistent with the existing app. Reuse its components, typography, icons, and tokens. Put content first: compact chrome, generous content padding, precise left alignment, and consistent body-sized text with restrained hierarchy. Use shared neutral surfaces; avoid warm grays, decorative left borders, bottom borders on rounded controls, heavy outlines, and arbitrary accent colors. Keep controls and states readable in both themes. Don't add unnecessary or superfluous text or ui.

Remove redundant labels, captions, counts, tooltips, and empty space. Prefer click-to-edit and inline actions over extra buttons or dialogs. Preserve focus, drafts, scroll position, and context. Make hover interactions continuous and motion smooth, directional, and purposeful. Fit narrow layouts without overlap or awkward nested scrolling. Keep visualizations readable and expressive. Inspect the rendered result and refine it before calling it done.
